            Ever since technology has evolved to the point where it is accessible to everyone, and different forms of it are used to send, receive, and store delicate information, the government has been monitoring it.
            This fact, however, was not a well known one up until a few years ago, and we have Edward Snowden to thank for exposing exactly how much the government monitors both the American people at the domestic level, and also other governments internationally.</div>

            <p><b>Who was Edward Snowden? What did he do?</b><br>
            <p>Edward Snowden worked for contractors of both the CIA and the NSA, and had access to documents of very high level of confidentiality that had to do with the government. After collecting enough documents that would prove that the American government was collecting data and different kinds of digital footprints on its citizens, he fled to China in March of 2013. After offering interviews to different news outlets, it was finally revealed that the NSA collected nearly 3 billion pieces of intelligence inside the U.S. in February 2013, and that the agency collects the data in bulk from massive fiber optic cables that carry most of the world's telephone and Internet traffic.
            </p>
            <p>He was tried for stealing information from the agencies, and as of this year, still resides in Russia where he avoids imprisonment.</p>

        <b>Why does this matter?</b><br>
        The impact this leak had on our nation overall is immeasurable. For one, the government relied on both our, and other nations, obliviousness to continue to infringe on “private information”. Till this day, we can’t conclusively say what was being done with all that information. Phone calls, texts, emails, and search history of potentially millions of people were being collected by the American Government without anyone's knowledge or consent. This completely turned over any semblance of privacy and freedom anyone might have felt online.
