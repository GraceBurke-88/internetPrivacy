            <h4>How to Protect Yourself: Going Deeper into Security</h4>
                Maybe you’ve heard of Tor before, perhaps related to browsing the darknet. If you have, you probably know the reason why users chose to use Tor is because it makes their location, both physical and virtual, untraceable. However, maybe you didn’t know you can use the TOR browser, for navigating regular websites, and still get a high level of anonymity while doing so. Although it was created by questionable cgroups that like to spy on people, it is still useful, just remember to turn off javascript (but breaks 95% internet) Try not to be so unique, use chrome, or another basic browser, and remove any crazy plugins.

            <h4>Zone 2</h4>
                While using your mobile device, keep in mind that texting is insecure, instead try to use imessage or switch over to signal (open source, encrypted). <br>
                Instead of using email (which can be invaded by providers) use proton mail which is secure.  This allows you to forward emails to new services, change the emails you get and start updating, after a few months updated.<br>
                Encryption for storage<br>
                The power of passwords cannot be reiterated enough, use strong passwords that cannot be easily guessed, and change them often. Do not use protection that is not a traditional password, fingerprinting and face scanners can be tempting to use, but they offer up biometrics that you may not want out there. Remember to also have a good password on your router as it is the main source of all your traffic, and hide your router information. <br>
                Avoid Chrome, use Firefox<br>
                If you’re really looking to protect your information use https sites, and instead of Chrome, use Firefox. Using Chrome is secure, but giving so much information to one company, Google, can hinder your ability to leave a small footprint. Again, make sure flash and javascript are disabled.

            <h4>Zone 3</h4>
            On OS’s it's important to note that Linux is more secure than other operating systems- it’s rarely targeted for attacks, and collects less information. <br>
                Again, make sure to password protect bios and storage drives / discs <br>
                Ditch Google- they like to collect data. <br>
                Not very convenient, but if you’re really committing to the cause, go to ‘my activity center’ and delete everything, most importantly, delete your google account.<br>
                DITCH YOUR SOCIAL MEDIA- seriously, the location tracking on some apps is scary.<br>.
                On smartphones: <br>
                Get basic flip phone, not very fashionable, but these phones get the job done, and don't have a lot of the tech we’re warning against on this site.<br>
                If you’re not ready to go back to 2006, how about getting an Android phone with ‘Privacy Custom ROM’.<br>
                As aforementioned, Tor is a great resource, getting a Tor browser bundle gets rid of any browser outside of TOR. It’s built off of firefox, and is one of the most popular onion routing implementations.<br> 
                On Iphones, consider using ‘Red onion’.<br>
                Hide your purchases, buy prepaid debit cards, use false info, use TOR to hide traffic, online use Bitcoin (cryptocurrency) although many websites don’t support them, their popularity is gaining traction.
